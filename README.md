## Introduction
  
### What is Shell 
A **shell** is a command-line interpreter, it is the computer program that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system. Depending on the type of interface they use, shells can be of various types, in this case, a shell program of the type **`sh`** ([Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)) will be developed. Users typically interact with a shell using a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) that is used for entering data into and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system.

### What is it for
This consists of interpreting orders. It incorporates features such as process control, input/output redirection, law listing and reading, protection, communications, and a command language for writing batch programs or scripts. All Unix-type systems have at least one interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell. The Bourne shell program is found within the Unix file hierarchy at **`/bin/sh`**.



## Project Information

### General requirements
 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
 * Your C programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
 * Your shell should not have any memory leaks
 * Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as `sh` (`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same error output.
 * The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your `argv[0]`
